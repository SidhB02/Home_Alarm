2nd Year Project - Home Alarm System (CADD)
This repository contains the files for my 2nd Year project in CADD (Computer-Aided Digital Design). The project implements a simple Home Alarm System using the Basys 3 FPGA Board, LEDs, and a buzzer. The design is written in SystemVerilog, and the code is programmed using Xilinx Vivado.

Project Structure
Source Files: These files contain the logic and are used to upload the design to the FPGA.
Testbench File (_tb): This file is used for simulating and verifying that the logic behaves as expected.
Constraints File (.xdc): This file maps the FPGA pins to the input/output variables of the design.
Additional Information
A detailed project description is available in the uploaded PDF. Please feel free to review it for a deeper understanding of the project.
